1.  Change propagation: possible cases
    Note: change can be directory, file, relationships

             Before                   After
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     case  | core | prod |  =>  | core | prod  | note
     ------- ---- - ---- -------- --- -- ---- -- -------------------------
     1     |  a'  |  a   |  =>  |  a'  |   a'  |  forward change
     2     |  a'  |  a*  |  =>  |  a'  |   a* '|  forward change merge
     3     |  a'  |  a*  |  =>  |  a'  |   a'  |  forward change override
     4     |  a'  |  a*  |  =>  |  a'  |   a   |  revert in product
     5     |  a   |      |  =>  |  a   |   a   |  forward change new item

     6     |  a   |  a'  |  =>  |  a'  |   a'  |  backward change
     7     |  a'  |  a*  |  =>  |  a' *|   a*  |  backward change merge
     8     |  a'  |  a*  |  =>  |  a*  |   a*  |  backward change override

4.  Sequence Merging (Text file)

5.  Ordered Tree Merging (XML file merging)

6.  Relationships and constraints

7.  Example (DITA)
