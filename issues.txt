1.  dynamic loading and editing results in null exception

Problem is it tries to loaded a new component.  OK, if new, don't load.

2.  conflict resolution is akward

The user is allowed only to edit his version of the file to make it mergable
with the other version?  There is chance that this never remove some conflicts.
If the user changed the other version,  a new version must be created and stored.
We don't want unnecessary versions to be created or do we?

3.  when we derive a product, we create share component for files referenced by
the ditamap.  The problem is that some dita files contains links to other files.
In another word, the file depends on other files and without them, we can't build
the dita project.  So, the solution is to extract links from these files as well
and share the files referenced by these links.

Question:
1.  Is it important to be able to build a project for the demo
2.  Change propagation does require merging of entire project.
